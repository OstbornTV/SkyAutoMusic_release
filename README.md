# Music AutoPlayer for PC

**Author:** Youcomposer and OstbornTV

**Version:** 0.3.4.1

**Date:** 2024-12-06

## Description

This Python-based tool simulates keystrokes on your computer to automatically play musical notes. It supports `.txt`, `.json`, and `skysheets` internal files for defining the notes to be played, allowing you to customize the playback speed.

## Features

- **File Selection**: Choose a `.txt` file containing notes in the format A1, A2, etc., or use `.json` and `.skysheets` files to define the musical notes.
- **Playback Speed Adjustment**: Select your preferred playback speed (slow, medium, fast) after choosing the file.
- **Automated Keystrokes**: Simulates the pressing of keys on your computer to play the notes automatically.
- **Long Key Presses**: Customize the duration of key presses in the program settings.

## Installation

1. Download the executable file (SkyAutoMusic.exe) from the releases page.
2. Install the .exe file to your preferred location, following the on-screen instructions.
3. Run the program by double-clicking on SkyAutoMusic.exe.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to select your music file and start playback.

## Important
and you would still have to manually rewrite the songs from the json, because the code does not yet read ‘2Key and or 3Key’.
I wanted to do that at times, so it may be that when you download songs that have to be rewritten again to ‘Key’ instead of the previously mentioned.

## Enjoy
Enjoy your musical journey in *Sky: Children of the Light*!
